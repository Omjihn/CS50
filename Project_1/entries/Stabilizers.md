# Stabilizers

Stabilizers are used under larger keys like the spacebar, enter, shift, and backspace to prevent them from wobbling and to ensure an even press.

-   Plate-Mounted Stabilizers: These are attached to the metal plate above the [PCB](../PCB) and are easier to install and replace.

-   PCB-Mounted Stabilizers: These are mounted directly to the [PCB](../PCB), offering a more secure fit and less noise.

Lubricating stabilizers can significantly reduce rattle and improve the overall typing experience.

Different types of stabilizers include:

-   Costar Stabilizers: Older design, known for their distinct feel but can be tricky to install.

-   Cherry Stabilizers: Most common modern stabilizers, easy to mod and maintain.

Stabilizers can be clipped and lubed for improved performance and quieter operation.
