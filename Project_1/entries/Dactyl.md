# Dactyl Keyboards

Dactyl keyboards are ergonomic split keyboards inspired by the Kinesis Advantage and designed with a unique curved layout to reduce strain and improve typing comfort.

Design: Dactyl keyboards are typically 3D-printed, featuring a concave layout that follows the natural curvature of the hands and fingers. This design aims to reduce wrist pronation and finger extension, which can alleviate repetitive strain injuries (RSI) associated with prolonged typing sessions.

Split Keyboard: Dactyl keyboards are split into two halves, allowing users to position each half independently to suit their shoulder width and typing posture. This split design promotes a more natural arm position and reduces tension in the shoulders and wrists.

Customization: Due to their 3D-printed nature, Dactyl keyboards are highly customizable. Enthusiasts can modify key layouts, [switch](../Switch) types, and even the curvature of the keyboard to fit their ergonomic needs and personal preferences.

Typing Experience: The curved key layout of Dactyl keyboards requires some adaptation for new users but can lead to faster and more comfortable typing once accustomed. Keycaps are often angled and positioned to minimize finger travel, optimizing typing efficiency.

Community and DIY Culture: Dactyl keyboards have a strong community of enthusiasts who share designs, modifications, and build guides online. Many users enjoy building their own Dactyl keyboards as a DIY project, learning about electronics, 3D printing, and keyboard customization in the process.

Variants: Variations of the Dactyl design include Dactyl-Manuform, which modifies the thumb cluster layout, and other custom adaptations that cater to specific ergonomic preferences and typing styles.

Usage: Dactyl keyboards are popular among programmers, writers, and anyone who spends extended periods typing and seeks ergonomic solutions to prevent discomfort and injury.
