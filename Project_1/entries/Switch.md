# Switch

The switch determines if the keyboard is mechanical or not. They can be replaced by [membranes](../Membranes).
Its main function is to register the user's pressure on the [keycap](../Keycap) and then send the information to the [PCB](../PCB).

A mechanical switch is made up of 6 parts: stem, switch housing, slider, 2 metal contact leaves, and a spring.
They can be disassembled and lubricated to change the sound they make.
Please do not lubricate them with vegetable oil or cheap lubricants.

There are 3 very popular types of switches: linear (red), tactile (brown), and clicky (blue).

-   Linear Switches: These have a constant pressure resistance and are the most common for gaming purposes.
    They provide a smooth keystroke from top to bottom without any tactile feedback, allowing for quick and consistent keypresses.

-   Tactile Switches: These require a little more pressure at the activation point, which helps prevent accidental clicks. They are generally preferred for typing purposes. The tactile bump provides feedback when the key is actuated, enhancing typing accuracy.

-   Clicky Switches: These have 2 clicks per activation: one just before the activation point and one at the same point when releasing the pressure. They are quite satisfying to use, but your co-workers might move your desk into the toilets because they are very loud. The audible click provides both sound and tactile feedback.

There are also optical switches, which are generally more responsive and more expensive.
Optical switches use light-based actuation, resulting in faster response times and greater durability since there is no physical contact required for actuation
These are favored in high-performance gaming keyboards.

Switches can be further customized with different spring weights, actuation points, and travel distances:

-   Spring Weights: Heavier springs require more force to press, which can reduce accidental key presses.

-   Lighter springs require less force, which can reduce finger fatigue during extended use.

-   Actuation Points: Some switches have adjustable actuation points, allowing users to customize the distance at which the keypress is registered.

-   Travel Distances: Shorter travel distances can result in faster keypresses, while longer travel distances provide more cushioning for each keypress.

Custom switch options are available for enthusiasts, including silent switches that reduce noise, speed switches for quicker actuation, and hybrid switches that combine different characteristics.
Lubrication of switches can improve smoothness and reduce noise, but it's important to use the correct lubricants designed for this purpose.

Switches are a critical component in determining the overall feel and performance of a keyboard, making them a popular subject of customization and experimentation among keyboard enthusiasts.
