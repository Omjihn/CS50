# PCB (Printed Circuit Board)

The PCB is the backbone of the keyboard. It is a flat board that connects all the [switches](../Switch) and other components electronically. The PCB determines the layout and functionality of the keyboard.

-   Single-Layer PCBs: These are simple and cost-effective but limited in functionality.

-   Multi-Layer PCBs: These provide more complex routing options and additional features like backlighting and programmable keys.

The PCB can also support features like hot-swappability, allowing users to change [switches](../Switch) without soldering.

Advanced PCBs might also support:

-   RGB Lighting: Integrated RGB lighting for customizable [backlighting](../Backlighting) effects.

-   Programmable Features: Allows for advanced macro programming and key remapping.

-   Wireless Connectivity: Some PCBs support Bluetooth or other wireless connections.

Maintaining and updating the PCB can extend the life of a keyboard and provide enhanced functionality over time.
