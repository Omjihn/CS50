# Membranes

Membrane keyboards, also known as rubber dome keyboards, operate differently from mechanical keyboards. Instead of individual mechanical [switches](../Switch), membrane keyboards use rubber domes layered over a circuit membrane.

Structure: Membrane keyboards have a rubber dome under each keycap. When a key is pressed, the rubber dome collapses, making contact with the circuit membrane beneath and completing an electrical circuit to register the keypress.

Characteristics: They are typically quieter and have a softer feel compared to mechanical keyboards. They are also generally less expensive to manufacture, making them popular for budget-friendly options.

Durability: Rubber dome keyboards can be less durable over time compared to mechanical [switches](../Switch), as the rubber domes may wear out with prolonged use.

Types: Some membrane keyboards incorporate scissor-switch mechanisms under the keycaps, offering a slightly better typing experience with improved stability and key travel.
