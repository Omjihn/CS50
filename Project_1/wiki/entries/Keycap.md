# Keycap

A keycap is one of the most visible parts of the keyboard. It goes on the [switch](../Switch) and allows the user to press the key without directly contacting the [switch](../Switch). Keycaps are typically made from durable plastic materials such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) or PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate).

-   ABS Keycaps: These are common and cost-effective but tend to wear out and become shiny over time.

-   PBT Keycaps: These are more durable and resistant to wear, often preferred by enthusiasts.

-    PBT keycaps may also have two layers, allowing light to shine through the characters for illuminated keyboards.

Keycaps can be customized in various ways:

-    Profiles: Different keycap profiles (e.g., OEM, Cherry, SA, DSA) offer varying heights and shapes, affecting the typing feel and aesthetics.

-   Colors and Themes: Keycaps come in numerous colors and themes, from plain single colors to elaborate designs inspired by popular culture.

-    Materials: Besides plastic, keycaps can be made from metal, wood, or even artisan materials like resin.

Artisan keycaps are unique, often handcrafted, and can be designed to look like various objects or characters. They can be highly detailed and visually striking. For example, some artisan keycaps resemble foods like cheese, but it's highly recommended not to eat them.

Keycap customization allows for personal expression and can significantly enhance the aesthetic appeal of a keyboard. Enthusiasts often mix and match keycaps to create unique combinations that reflect their personal style. Additionally, some keycaps are designed to improve functionality, such as textured keycaps for gaming, which help users locate specific keys by feel.

Proper care and cleaning of keycaps can extend their lifespan. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water, along with avoiding excessive force when removing or replacing keycaps, can keep them in good condition.
