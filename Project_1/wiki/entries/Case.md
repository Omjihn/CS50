# Case

A keyboard case is generally made of plastic for economic and weight reasons. Its size is standardized, with the most common sizes ranging from 60% to 100%.

    60% Case: This size is compact and portable, omitting the function row, navigation cluster, and numpad. It’s favored by minimalist enthusiasts and those who need a small footprint.
    75% Case: This size retains the function row but still omits the numpad, offering a balance between compactness and functionality.
    Tenkeyless (TKL) Case: This case includes the function row and navigation cluster but omits the numpad, providing a good compromise between size and usability for most users.
    Full-size Case: This size includes the full array of keys, including the numpad, making it the most versatile and user-friendly for those who need all the keys available.

Keyboard cases can also be made from other materials such as aluminum, which offers a premium feel and added durability at a higher cost and weight. Some custom keyboards even use wood or acrylic for unique aesthetics.

In addition to material and size, the design of the case can vary:

    High-profile cases: These have taller sides that cover the switches, providing a cleaner look and potentially reducing noise.
    Low-profile cases: These expose the switches and keycaps more, offering a different aesthetic and slightly reduced weight.

Case customization is a popular aspect of mechanical keyboard hobbyists. Many enjoy painting, adding stickers, or even designing custom cases using 3D printing. The case not only protects the internal components but also contributes significantly to the keyboard’s overall look and feel.
